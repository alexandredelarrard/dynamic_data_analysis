{"bio": ["Player Bio", "Personal Year By Year", "In an era of Spanish clay kings, Thomas Muster was pre-eminent. At his dominant best from the baseline, the barrel-chested Austrian harnessed tremendous balance off both wings to wear down his rivals with heavy topspin body blows. He ranks as one of the best clay-courters of all time. ", "On 1 April 1989, in his fifth season as a pro, Muster found himself in hospital, just two hours after he had just come back from two sets down to beat World No. 13 Yannick Noah to reach the Miami final. His career had been on an upward trajectory, until he was the victim of a drunk driver \u2013 37-year-old Norman Sobie \u2013 who had severed cruciate and side ligaments in his left knee.", "Muster flew back to Vienna for surgery, thinking he would make a quick recovery. Doctors weren\u2019t so sure. The 22 year old started training almost immediately. He was famously pictured hitting tennis balls in a special chair, with his left leg in a cast. Six months later, he returned and went onto be named the ATP\u2019s Comeback Player of the Year. The greatest Austrian player in tennis history went onto win 45 titles, including 1995 Roland Garros. In 1996, he ranked World No. 1 for six weeks.", "Muster won eight ATP Masters Series titles on three different surfaces, including three titles apiece at Monte-Carlo and Rome. He won 24 straight clay-court finals between May 1990 and July 1995. In 1993, he lifted seven trophies and won 55 of his 65 matches on red dirt. Two years later, he was crowned the \u201cKing of Clay\u201d when he won 40 consecutive clay-court matches \u2013 the longest winning streak on the surface since Bjorn Borg had won 46 between 1977-1979. Muster beat Michael Chang 7-5, 6-2, 6-4, on his 10th attempt in Paris, to capture his lone major title. He compiled a 65-2 record on clay and won a record 12 tournaments in 1995. Roger Federer achieved the feat in 2004.", "Muster, 5\u201911\u201d, played his last professional match in May 1999, moved to Queensland, Australia, and ballooned to 218lbs. The 1990 and 1995 Austrian Sportsman of the Year never made a formal retirement announcement, but he made occasional appearances on the ATP Champions Tour and was his nation\u2019s Davis Cup captain, until, 11 years after his Roland Garros farewell, he staged a comeback. After undergoing a punishing fitness regime, working out for up to seven hours per day, he weighed 167lbs \u2013 the same he had weighed aged 22. In November 2011 at Vienna, he said farewell to tennis.", "An astute businessman, Muster established fashion label \u201cToms\u201d in 2003. As a wine-lover, he teamed up with tennis-loving vintner Manfred Tement to cultivate eight hectares of land and put out their first joint Toms Hochkittenberg wine in 2005.", "MAJOR TITLES (1) - French 1995.", "DAVIS CUP \u2013 1984-91, 94-97; 36-8 singles, 9-10 doubles.", "SINGLES RECORD IN THE MAJORS \u2013 Australian (23-11), French (32-13), Wimbledon (0-4), US (22-10).", "Bio: James Buddell ", "  Muster was widely considered his generation\u2019s \u2018King Of Clay, and was one of fittest players during his career on Tour\u2026 it paid off in 1995 when he claimed the Roland Garros title and reached No. 1 in February of 1996, becoming the second oldest player to attain the ranking (Newcombe).", "  As a 16 year old in 1984, Muster won his first tour-level match in Kitzbuehel (d.
